# interceptors-csharp
A free and open source library to implement interceptors in c#
# Warning
There is an issue with function token solving between Assemblies, and due lack of time and knowledge in "low level" CIL, I give up this project for now.
If you wish to take back the project, I am ready to add anyone as contributor or owner.
